<h3><u>What went right? What went wrong?</u><h3>
<p>I installed the software I needed without any issue. After watching the Panopto videos and studying the book I was able to customize HTML files and stylessheets.
</p>

<h3><u>What was easy? What was hard?</u><h3>
<p> Downloading Notepadd++ was easy enough and although I faced some minor hurdles, nothing was too hard to overcome.
<br> </p>


<h3><u>Issues I faced.</u><h3>
<p> -One issue I ran into was my text size being too large on my reflection.html file. Another was my picture taking up far too much of the screen. I fixed the text sizing issue by matching the heading tags. 
<br> -Another issue I encountered was not being able to alter the styles in the body section of my external stylesheet. I found that placing it last in my code would work but whatever style was listed first in my code would not work. I believe it has something to do with the cascading order in which the programs applies the style but am unsure. 
</p>


<h3><u>What editor was used?</u><h3>
<p> Notepad++ for Windows.
</p>

<h3><u>What browser was used to test my html page?</u><h3>
<p> I use Chrome browser.
</p>

<h3><u>What happened the first time you viewed your page in a browser to test it?</u><h3>
<p> My first webpage loaded with text but did not display my image properly and it overwhelmed my text. It needed to be resized.
</p>

<h3><u>How did you finally manage to resize the image? </u><h3>
<p>I had to edit my picture size down to thumbnail size (193x176px).
